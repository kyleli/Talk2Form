A hospital visit in English Come in. Ms. Bellamy? Yes. Hi, I'm Connie Harris. I'll be your doctor today. Let me just wash my hands really quick. Would you prefer Ms. Bellamy or would you... Can I call you Pat? Pat's fine. Great. Well, it's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Can you tell me why you're here today? I have a terrible headache. It looks really bad. Oh, yes. Is there anything else besides your headache that you want to address here today at the clinical program? No, it's just that, except I am concerned. I just recently changed insurance companies and I'm not sure this is going to be covered yet. All right. Was there anything... Because what we can do is while we're talking and I'm doing your history and physical, I will have my office secretary look into the insurance plan that you have. Okay. All right. So you don't have to worry about that. Yeah, that sounds good. Okay, sounds great. Is there anything else? No, I just... This is just really bad. Okay. So what I'd like to do today is let's take a look at what's causing your headache. All right. I will go over history, physical, and then we'll do, again, a physical exam. And then we will look into your insurance policy and make sure that's all taken care of. Does that sound like a good plan for you? Yeah, that's good. Perfect. So tell me a little bit more about this, the head pain that you're having. Well, it started about three days ago, and nothing has helped. It's just laid me flat. I haven't been able to go to work. It's... Nothing's helped. I... It's all over. It's really bad when I move, so I'm trying not to move too much. And the light is bothering me a lot. Okay. And unfortunately, I can't dim the lights in this room. Okay. All right. So I'll try to go quickly, and would it be okay if I took some notes? Oh, sure. Yes. All right. So you said this headache started about three days ago? Yeah. Okay. Was there anything that brought it on, anything unusual that happened maybe three days ago? Not really, no. Okay. Can you tell me anything that makes it better? Oh, nothing's made it better. Okay. I took some Tylenol. I tried Motrin. Nothing. I just try not to move too much. All right. Is there anything that makes it worse? Yeah. Like movement? Movement. And light. Okay. And it's just constant, though. There's, you know, it doesn't... It's just constant. It's all over. Okay. So if you had to rate it on a pain scale, zero being no pain, ten being the worst pain you ever had? It's a ten. I've never had a headache like this. Okay. Yeah, that sounds really bad. Now, as far as radiation, does that move? You said the head, the pain is all up here in the front of your head? It's kind of all over. Okay. But also, I've got this shooting pain down my neck, and my neck is very stiff. Okay. But it's not... It's the entire head. Entire head. Okay. Yeah. As far as in the timing, you said that it started three days ago, but you said it's a constant. Yeah, it started gradually, but once it got there, it hasn't gone away. It doesn't get better. It doesn't get worse. It's just the same. Okay. So do you... What I want to get is your perception of what you think is going on. I don't know. I just can hardly think. It's so painful. I just... Because it's so bad, I was afraid. My neighbor had a headache and ignored it last year, and he suddenly started having seizures, and it turns out he had a brain tumor, so I thought I just should come in and look at that. Yeah, I can understand your concern. How is it impacting your daily life? I can't go to work. I can't do anything. Okay. So it sounds like it's really impacting your life. Yeah, I can't. If it's okay, I would like to go talk a little bit about your medical history and your self-service. Okay, sure. Can you tell me, as far as your medical history, do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of? I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about three years ago, but we've been addressing it with diet changes. Okay, so it's controlled with diet? Yeah, I go in yearly. I had been just... And it's been well-controlled, so I haven't been on medication. No meds for that? But other than that, I haven't had any problems. Okay. Any surgical history? No. Any hospitalizations? No. All right. And you said the only medicine you were taking was the Tylenol maltreatment. Does it help? Yeah, and they didn't help. Okay. Just wanted to verify. Do you have any drug allergies? No. Okay. What about family history? Do you have any medical history of headaches or... In my family? Right. What about your sister? My mom said she used to get migraines when she was in her 20s and 30s. Okay. But I don't remember her saying anything else about it. My sister... I have one sister. She's healthy. My dad, he has high blood pressure. Other than that, he's healthy. And that's about it. I don't have any kids. All right. Sorry, I would like to ask you some social history questions just for... There are records. Okay. Do you smoke? Yeah, I do. Is it cigarettes or chewing? Yes, it's cigarettes. Okay. And how much do you smoke? About a half a pack a day. Okay. What about alcohol? I don't drink. Okay. Also, are you married? Yeah, I'm married. Okay. And children? No. Okay. And just some additional questions is looking at your kind of GYN history, are you last menstrual period? Oh, I'm in menopause. Okay. So going back into the history again, have you... You said your mom had migraines earlier on. Have you been around and no other... You haven't been... Nauseous. Or have you been... Yeah, I've been nauseous. Okay. In fact, I threw up twice early on. Okay. Because when I move, it makes me nauseous. Okay. Nothing out of the ordinary over the past couple of weeks. Have you been on any trips or anything? Actually, a week ago, I was in North Carolina for a family reunion, and there was a four-year-old who was sick there. I don't know what they had, but I guess they ended up taking him into emergency. Okay. So let me just summarize to make sure I've got everything straight so far. You started having an onset of a severe headache about three days ago. It's worse with movement. Light really makes it hurt bad. It's a 10 out of 10 pain, and you're also complaining of a stiff neck with that. Yes. It came on gradually, and it's been constant pain in the frontal area. Medical history, you're in hyper... You have high blood pressure, but that's controlled with diet. No surgical history, no really hospitalizations. The pain, though, is really impacting your day-to-day living and daily life. You tried Tylenol and Motrin. It didn't help. Otherwise, no medications. You've got the family history of your mom with migraines. Otherwise, your family is healthy. Yes. You smoke about a half a pack a day. You don't drink. And then you said you took a trip about a week ago or two weeks ago. Yes. Okay. It was a family reunion a week ago. You might have been pregnant with someone who was sick. Yes, I don't know. It was in North Carolina. All right. I can understand your concern about your friend. You said that it was having seizures. I've just never had this kind of pain before. I can understand that. What I would like to do is... We've pretty much gone over the history. What I'd like to do is complete a physical exam, do some testing. I want to ask, too, if there are any other concerns I need to address before we get to that final exam. Okay. That sounds good. Okay. Sounds great. Okay.
